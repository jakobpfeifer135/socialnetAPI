# socialnetAPI


## Description



- What was your motivation?
To learn how i can use different routes in insomnia to target different functionality such as adding friends or reactions to a users comment.
- Why did you build this project?
To show how data can be stored by using a server-like database that holds individual features like friends comments and reactions.
- What did you learn?
i learned so much about keeping user data ready to use on a social media like app so if i ever wanted to make a social media app i could have threads and reactions as well as having the ability to add friends and have someone be able to find their friends by name although we use id.
